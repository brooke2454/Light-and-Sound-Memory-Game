# Light-and-Sound-Memory-Game
This repository contains my work on the Light and Sound Memory Game for my Codepath application. The goal of the game is to memorize the sequence the game gives you and then repeat the sequence back to the game by pressing a series of buttons in the order in which the buttons were pressed.
